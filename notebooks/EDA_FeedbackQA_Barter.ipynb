In  exchange we would like 1 story or post on your Instagram, Youtube, or Tiktok channel and would like you to tag Zippit in that story and add a link to the webshop.\n\nWe are definitely open to paid long term collaborations. We can for instance pay you for every single sale made through your personal link. Let us know if you are interested in this.\n\nWho we are. We sell medical grade strips (aka mouth tape) designed to tape your mouth shut before sleeping (or other times when you want to breathe through your nose). Taping your mouth shut is an emerging trend because it encourages nasal breathing, resulting in:\n- sleeping better\n- having more energy in the morning and throughout the day\n- better oral health\n- no more dry mouth\n- a more defined face and jawline\n- better physical and cognitive performance\n\nThe campaign goal now is to become visible and also encourage direct purchases. This can be through video, photos or any other creative form you can think of. We are certainly open to ideas.\n\nBe sure to take a look at our website and follow our socials:\n- Website --> www.go-zippit.com or for Dutch --> www.zippit.nl\n- Instagram --> @zippit__  \n- Tiktok --> @zippit_nl",

In samenwerking met een gerenommeerd PR-bureau en een overheidsinstantie vragen we aandacht voor waterbewustzijn, op een grappige en vrolijke manier. Veel mensen spoelen onterecht producten als maandverband, doekjes en frituurvet door het toilet, wat grote schade aanricht in het riool. Daarom lanceren we: De Unflushables - reusachtige, kleurrijke opblaasversies van afval dat niet thuishoort in het riool. Denk aan een mega maandverband, condoom, pillenstrip of make-updoekje. Alle ingrediënten voor superleuke content!\n\nJe ontvangt:\n• Financiële vergoeding van €150\n• Een unieke ervaring op locatie\n• Contentboost via Spark Ad of Collab\n\nWat zoeken we?\nWe zoeken content creators om mee te doen aan een unieke shoot op de Unflushables: reusachtige opblaasbare versies van verkeerd doorgespoeld afval, zoals maandverband, make-updoekjes of condooms. De shoot vindt plaats in natuurwater in Noord-Holland: Stadsstrand Hoorn. De exacte tijden volgen nog maar ga ervan uit dat je in de ochtend en middag aanwezig moet zijn.\n\n• Comfortabel in zwemkleding en natuurwater\n• Spontaan, energiek en representatief\n\nWat doe je?\n• Dobberen op de Unflushables (in natuurwater)\n• Content maken op locatie\n• Meedoen aan een superleuke shoot",

Dit is de dagelijkse realiteit voor veel mensen met hartproblemen. Hun hart functioneert niet optimaal, waardoor kostbare energie verloren gaat. Dat moet veranderen!\n\nDaarom lopen op zaterdag 2 november ruim 4.500 mensen mee met de 11strandentocht, een tocht langs elf prachtige Hollandse stranden, georganiseerd door de Hartstichting. Het is een uitdagende route over zand, door de duinen en langs de woeste zee. Weer of geen weer, deze stoere tocht gaat altijd door!\n\nWaarom de 11strandentocht?\nIn Nederland leven 1,7 miljoen mensen met een hart- of vaataandoening. Zonder ingrijpen zal dit aantal binnen zeven jaar met bijna 1 miljoen toenemen. Dat is onacceptabel. Samen kunnen we dit stoppen.\n\nRoep met jouw bereik zoveel mogelijk mensen op om te doneren via www.11strandentocht.nl/steun, of schrijf je in voor dé ultieme uitdaging voor renners, joggers en wandelaars die hun hart willen inzetten om geld in te zamelen! Elke bijdrage helpt om hart- en vaatziekten buiten de deur te houden!",
