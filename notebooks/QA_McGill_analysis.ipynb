    "I have designed the formative rater to be able to detect anomalies in QA pairs. The answers are matched to a question using an embedding model, and we see that sometimes it a seemingly good answer is retreived that upon closer inspection does not relate to the question at all. Based on the feedback the human raters have provided, we see that it occurs that one human rater did not catch the anomaly, while the other did. This results in maximal disagreement, where one rating is 4 and the other is 1. LLMs, especially smaller models, are prone to making these mistakes as well, but we hypothesize that by using deconstructive prompting we provide sufficient context to the model to catch the anomaly, even if it would have missed it with a holistic prompt. Essentially, the formative prompt models the anomalies explicitly. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, when the input is confusing (as would be the case with the anomalies), the model should be confused as well. Moreover, it should not be confused when we explicitly model the source of confusion. Entropy should therefore be higher for maximal disagreement items for the holistic prompt, whereas it should be lower for the formative prompt. This relies on the assumption that the model does not miss the anomaly entirely: in this case, it would be confidently wrong (low entropy). \n",

    "###The Conclusion: XML as a \"Noise Filter\" for Uncertainty\n",
    "The most significant finding here is not about specific dimensions, but about the **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** of your uncertainty metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "####1. The Non-XML Prompt: \"General Fog\" (High Median, High Correlation)* **Observation:** The median entropy is high (~0.30).\n",
    "* **Interpretation:** The model is experiencing a high baseline of \"cognitive load.\" It is likely spending probability mass figuring out the *format* and *structure* of the prompt, in addition to the actual answer quality.\n",
    "* **Result:** The entropy signal is a mix of **Epistemic Uncertainty** (Prompt Confusion) and **Aleatoric Uncertainty** (Data Ambiguity). The correlation exists because the Aleatoric signal is present, but it is \"buried\" in a generally noisy distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "####2. The XML Prompt: \"Specific Alarm\" (Low Median, High Correlation)* **Observation:** The median entropy collapses to near zero (~0.07), yet the correlation with human disagreement remains robust (0.18–0.24).\n",
    "* **Interpretation:** The XML tags solve the \"Epistemic\" problem. The model knows *exactly* where the data is and what the task is, so it is not confused by the format. The baseline \"formatting noise\" disappears.\n",
    "* **Result:** Because the baseline is so low, **any spike in entropy is highly significant.** When the entropy rises in the XML model, it is almost exclusively reacting to the **Aleatoric Uncertainty** (the difficulty of the content).\n",
    "\n",
    "###Thesis ArgumentYou can present this as a methodological finding regarding **Calibration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"We observed a distinct distributional shift in model uncertainty between the two prompting strategies. The naive (non-XML) prompt yielded a high median entropy (~0.30), suggesting the model retained significant epistemic uncertainty regarding the task structure. In contrast, the XML-structured prompt successfully suppressed this baseline uncertainty, reducing the median entropy to ~0.07.*\n",
    "> *Crucially, despite this massive drop in overall uncertainty, the XML prompt maintained a positive correlation with human disagreement (r \\approx 0.18-0.24). This indicates that **XML tagging acts as a high-pass filter for uncertainty**: it eliminates the 'background noise' of formatting confusion, ensuring that high-entropy states are specific indicators of genuine data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty), rather than model confusion.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "###Why this is scientifically safer1. **It avoids speculation:** You don't have to guess why \"Completeness\" behaved differently than \"Directness.\" You simply note that *both* retained positive signal despite the baseline shift.\n",
    "2. **It explains the \"Outliers\":** You correctly noted that \"when it is high, disagreement is also high.\" This supports the idea that in the XML model, high entropy is an **Event**, whereas in the non-XML model, high entropy is the **Norm**.\n",
    "3. **It justifies the method:** It argues that XML is superior not just because it follows instructions better, but because it produces a **cleaner uncertainty signal** for detecting hard samples."
